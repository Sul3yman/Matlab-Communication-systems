function [datastream]=Receiver(Channel, FrameLength)
%<Receiver> Receive the information bits sent by the Transmitter via the 
%channel (Channel)
%
%   Function inputs:
%       <Channel>       - Object used for identifying the channel between 
%                         the client and the server
%       <FrameLength>   - variable used to specify the number of 
%                         information bits per packet
%   
%   Function output: 
%       <datastream>    - received information bits that should be returned
%                         to the upper layers in the server

% Algorithm description             %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Here is given an example of how to implement an stop and wait ARQ 
%   receiver (update this section with your actual implementation): 
%
%     1. Check for data
%     2. if frame correctly received and not earlier received, store and
%        update R_next (sequence number)
%     3. if frame correctly received send acknowledgement frame
%     4. if all data received terminate connection  
%
%   The greener the code, the better the environment! (Use comments!)
